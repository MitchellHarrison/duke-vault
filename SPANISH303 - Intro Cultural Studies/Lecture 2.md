##### Art√≠culo de Silverman

He seems fed up with the term "fake news" at it's used today, but I wonder what he would choose if the choice was between never using that term again or using it as it is now. Surely there needs to be a term for *actual* fake news (as he originally defined it); perhaps "mis/disinformation?" They aren't really the same thing, but it seems like any attempt at defining a new term would be immediately co-opted by the people that started mis-using "fake news."

##### Tipos de noticias falsas

It's interesting that propaganda is considered neutral but partisan analysis is medium-impact. In my mind, partisan analysis is near-impossible to avoid, and is more often beneficial than propaganda is. The Wall Street Journal is (arguably) a mostly-conservative establishment, but I wouldn't call them harmful. OAN is right-wing propaganda, but is almost certainly more harmful than the WSJ. I can think of any number of similar examples, but very few that run in the opposite direction (where propaganda is more harmful than partisanship).
