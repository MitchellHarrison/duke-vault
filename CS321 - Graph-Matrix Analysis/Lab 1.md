# Lab 1 

## Question 4

#### 4A
Here $d()$ is a degree vector and $d(1:n) = \{1, 2, \cdots, n\}$. Additionally, $e$ is a vectors of all 1's. Thus, here, $d(1:n)$ contains the degree of node $i$

Thus, if we work through the matrix algebra, this becomes **TRUE**.

#### 4B

**TRUE**

#### 4C

## Question 5

**TRUE**

## Question 6

The smallest $k$ such that $A^k\ne 0$.

## Question 7

[This article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix) will at least show that $diag(d) - A = L$.
