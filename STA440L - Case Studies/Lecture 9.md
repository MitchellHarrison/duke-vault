## Peer Review Assignment

There is a Github repo (called `case-files`) for the course that contains files about a study conducted on the waste generated by high-rise building construction. It is an individual assignment and will be completed and submitted alone.

## Case Study 2

The second case study is about a drug use monitoring experiment. This case study comes in two parts:
1. Reproduce the results presented by authors in the attached study.
2. Construct an original model using the same data.

Opioids are highly addictive drugs that can regularly lead to addiction. Even legal users with prescriptions can become addicts and lead to illicit use and ultimately death. Researchers are trying to catch an opioid use issue before it becomes too bad. The gold standard for identifying risky behaviors is called the ASSIST framework, which is a WHO-created screener that a practitioner can use to interview a patient that is on opioids legally.

> [!note]
> ASSIST is also used for alcohol, marijuana, and many other drugs. We will be focussing on opioids only.

Researchers use the **NS score**, which can be calculated from patient prescription records without involvement by the patient (e.g., a survey). The hope is that NS scores can predict high-risk behaviors (as determined by ASSIST, which is considered to be 100% accurate for our purposes).

> [!note]
> One of our tasks will be to calculate ASSIST score, so it is not included in the data provided by the study.
