# Critical Review

> [!definition]
> **Peer review** is the "expert assessment of submitted materials," and is used to help ensure that published materials are of high quality and free from mistakes. It is used to maintain quality standards and credibility in shared results.

A common framework for peer review is **describe, evaluate, suggest**. First, we describe our understanding of what the authors have done. This helps clarify how audiences may misunderstand what authors have presented.
