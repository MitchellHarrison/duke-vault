# Lecture 8 - Communicating Statistics

## Example 1

For a sufficiently large dataset in which no observation effects any others, we can randomly sample from a population data. If you do this enough times and take the mean each time, the distribution of all of those means will be a normal distribution centered on 0.

1. distribution is centered on 0
2. n = 30 is usually good enough
3. dataset has to be big enough to sample 
4. no observation can effect another observation.

## Example 2

The HPLC machine pressurizes a liquid and forces that liquid through a substance, and each component of the liquid travels through at different speed. The HPLC machine tracks the speed of the different elements by how long it takes to get through the "filter." If we know how long different elements take to get through a given filter, we can get an idea of what components made up the liquid. A graph can be produced where different peaks represent different materials in the liquid.
