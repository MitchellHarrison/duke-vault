## Data Science

In this class, we will combine *math/stats*, *computer science*, and *domain knowledge* to arrive at solutions to problems. This combination gives rise to data science as its own discipline. We will conduct our work in three steps: first we *wrangle* our data, then *analyze* that data, and finally *present* our results with visualizations, etc.
