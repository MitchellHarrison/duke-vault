#### How did the Cold War shape our conceptions of democracy and liberalism?

#### Who was Hegel?

Hegel was a philosopher and predecessor to Marx. He first discussed the idea that history could have a beginning, middle, and end. He saw human behaviors as arising from 

#### Who was Marx?

Marx was a political philosopher and socialist. He wrote extensively in critique of capitalism, and remains among the most widely-known philosophers of all time (perhaps infamously so in the West).

#### What is the relationship between the social theories of Hegel and Marx?

Both Hegel and Marx saw history as having a definitive beginning, middle, and end. This allows for the belief that the "end of history" is possible at all. 

#### How did Hegel conceptualize history?

Hegel saw history as a process from primitive systems of tribes, slavery, etc. towards more democratic societies: the final form of government. That is, he saw history has having a beginning, middle, and end, especially around government organizational structures.

#### Why did Fukuyama think that history had come to an end after the Cold War?

He saw that the end of the Cold War as the mark of the final convergence to liberal democracy as the "final form of human government," as if all of human history was an exercise in trying to find the optimal form of government, and it had concluced.

#### What was the appeal of Francis Fukuyama’s views about the End of History?

He sees the end of history as a largely peaceful time, but he somehow laments the lack of inter-system conflict, citing the art and culture that blooms around deep ideological struggles. He says that humanity will be relegated to the role of a "museum-keeper," looking back at times of great men and women struggling for political gain while never participating themselves.

His take-away seems to be that massive ideological wars make humanity what it is, and that the end of history is (direct quote) "sad."

#### Would peace and prosperity follow the End of History according to Fukuyama?

He views the developing world as a long-term breeding ground for conflict. But he also states that *"the struggle between two opposing systems is no longer a determining tendency of the present-day era."* This has largely proven true so far, as we haven't seen any wars (save \[in some ways] perhaps Ukraine?) between states on purely ideological grounds.

However, he explicitly states that the "end of history" does not mean "the end of international conflict" in total.

#### What is democracy according to Zakaria?

Democracy (separate from liberal democracy) is a system by which elected leaders are chosen. It is generally marked by free and fair elections, but the rights that follow such elections are a separate matter from the elections themselves.

#### What differentiates liberal democracy from democracy according to Zakaria?

Zakaria uses the example of Bosnia, where people were worried that a free and fair election would be held, but non-democratic candidates would be elected. Democracy is the machine by which we elect leaders, but liberalism ensures that basic freedoms are met by those leaders through balance of powers, etc.

#### What are indicators of a liberal regime?

Zakaria says:
1. free and fair democratic elections
2. protection of speech, assembly, and religion
3. rule of law
4. separation of powers

#### How does illiberalization take place?

In south-central Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America democratically-elected leaders have bypassed certain constitutional practices, which can lead to the breaking down of democratic institutions, and thereby illiberalization.

#### Are there connections between GDP, democracy, armed conflicts, class structures, distribution of wealth, etc.?

Yes. Usually, high GDP, capitalism, etc. are markers of a full-fledged liberal democracy. But this is not necessarily always the case. China has a massive economy (although less so per-capita), and is very obviously not a liberal democracy.

#### What criteria should a regime have to count as a democracy?

Democracy (with the *liberalism*) requires very little. It demands free and fair elections and universal suffrage and participation in those elections. Liberalism (especially constitutional liberalism) demands much more.

#### How is a liberal democracy different from merely a democracy?

Zakaria uses the example of Bosnia, where people were worried that a free and fair election would be held, but non-democratic candidates would be elected. Democracy is the machine by which we elect leaders, but liberalism ensures that basic freedoms are met by those leaders through balance of powers, etc.

#### Is there a relationship between liberal democracy and economic conditions/structures of a society?

Yes. The great majority of the time, a liberal democracy has a capitalistic economy and a high per-capita GDP.

#### What does a global context that is conducive to liberal democracy look like?

Strong international democratic norms are paramount for the success of liberal democracy. International organizations like the UN can also assist, as can an increasingly connected global economy, where wars become additionally costly.

#### What role does a constitution play in a country? Democracy? Liberal democracy?

The freedoms that liberalism enjoys (speech, assembly, etc.) are defended best by a constitution that guarantees these rights.

#### What is the role of elections in a democracy?

Obviously, elections are an essential element of democracy. They are required for a state to be considered democratic at all. However, democracy does not equal liberalism or constitutional rule.

#### Is liberal democracy the best political regime? Why?

The word "best" is difficult to quantify, but liberal democracy seems to be the best system currently in practice to guarantee the greatest amount of individual liberty. Perhaps other systems will blossom in the future that will improve on democracy, but it's impossible to say for now.

#### What external and internal challenges can a liberal democracy face?

There is an inherent tension between constitutional liberalism and democracy. Democracy is a means of gathering and using political power, while constitutional liberalism specifically limits the power of the state (and even of individuals, should they hope to infringe on others' rights).

However, it is easy to confuse a legitimate government for a powerful one. In South America, many leaders have promised order by increasing their own power, but that does not necessarily mean that those governments are legitimate (they've arrested opponents, silenced dissent, etc.)

#### How does a country move from being liberal to illiberal?

Democratic elections of leaders that go on to consolidate power, weaken the system of checks and balances, and do away with other civil and economic liberties can bring about illiberalization.

#### How does a country move from being democratic to non-democratic?

Ukraine is an example. Although it was a struggling democracy before the invasion, democratic norms have been shattered since Russia's invasion. Martial law has long been declared, and elections are forbidden for the foreseeable future. Hitler (much more maliciously) used a similar tactic. After being democratically elected, he consolidated power and declared an emergency, replacing representatives in the Reichstag with puppets and eventually doing away with elections entirely.

#### Can a country’s prospects of democracy and/or liberalism be predicted? How?

While imperfect, some indicators exist to predict a democratic future. Zakaria uses the example of the former British colonies. Although colonialism is non-democratic by definition, most former British colonies remain democratic to some extent, especially compared to others in their region.

It may have once been the case that an improving economy predicted movement towards liberalism and/or democracy, but China's recent meteoric rise seems to prove the contrary.

## Lecture Notes

**The long telegram** was an attempt to contain Soviet power and influence worldwide. This included literal expansion (i.e. military expansion) but more specifically the spread of communism, anti-capitalism, and other Soviet ideologies.

The argument for containment instead of forceful intervention is that if we keep Soviet ideology where it is, it will fail on its own. But angering/attacking the Soviet regime could solidify it and delay its collapse. The prediction (which held true) was that if we give the Soviet Union enough time, it will destroy itself from within without explicit military intervention.

But even after the collapse, the people that were once in Soviet institutions still held Soviet political leanings. What occurred was the collapse of a state without the necessary collapse of ideology. Many Soviet bloc states wanted to stay in the Union, but because Russia was leaving the Union, that became impossible. So we were left with many leftover political institutions and personnel that basically just changed the their national communist party in name only. That meant that they were no longer trying to establist/spread communism, but the authoritarianism remained.

Long story short, **containment defined the Cold War**. The Cold War ends with the collapse of the Communist ideology.
