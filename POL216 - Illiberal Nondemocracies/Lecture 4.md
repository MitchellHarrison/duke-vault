## Hegel and Marx

The primary divide between Hegel and Marx was Hegel's focus on **idealism** vs Marx's **materialism**. Hegel lived through the early 19th-century, but Marx was born in the beginning of that century. Thus, Marx comes after Hegel. 

Marx said that Hegel "got it right, but upside-down." Marx looked to set it right. That is, Marx believed that we started at a primitive state, and *progress* came on the back of various changed in society, technology, etc.

For Hegel, this **progress** was on the back of better *ideas*, and for Marx, the progress was on the back of improving *material conditions*.

### Hegel's "ideas"

For Hegel, there was something *common* that defined the age that anyone lives in. That is, not everyone's ideas were the same, but there was some shared portion that evolved (and improved) over time. This evolution captured shared perceptions, philosophical shifts, etc.

> [!definition]
> Alternatively to phenomenon, the reality of the tree is the **thing-in-itself**. Kant argues that the thing-in-itself cannot be known, and should we should not be concerned with it.

Because Hegel was concerned not with the *thing-in-itself*, but the *phenomenon*. That is why Hegel is described as an **idealist**. The ideas that Hegel talks about are called the **zeitgeist**, or "spirit of the time." This zeitgeist can shift over time and by society, but in Hegel's time, Europe was considered to have the most advanced zeitgeist.

## Dialectics

Say we have one zeitgeist $A$. As $A$ advances and times change, a second zeitgeist $B$ begins to emerge. In this case, $A$ is a **thesis** and $B$ is an **anti-thesis**. Eventually, $A$ and $B$ merge to form $C$, which becomes the new thesis. Eventually, a new anti-thesis will emerge, the process repeats.

> This process (from thesis to anti-thesis to the synthesis of the two), is called **dialectics**.

When Fukuyama talks about the "end of history," he means that we are at the end of *dialectics*. That is, we have arrived at $Z$: liberal democracy.

## Marx's materialism

Before the romantic movement, thinkers were worried about *universal truths*. This came as a response to the development of what we call "science" in Europe. Science calls these universal truths **laws**. Under these laws, the truth anywhere is the truth everywhere.

The question then becomes: *Are there universal laws for humans*? **Enlightenment** thinkers were searching for such rules.

Romantic thinkers, under the influence of Hegel, began to have suspicion about whether or not this human laws could exist. Perhaps there is no universality, but we are all unique. They extended these thought to societies; each society may have their own ideas an emotions. This challenges Hegel's *universalism*.

> In reaction to the universalist claims of enlightenment thinkers, thinkers went out to get to know individual nations' zeitgeists. This gave rise to **nationalism**.

> [!definition]
> The philosophical evolution from nationalism was **materialism**, which was not concerned with phenomena or universal laws, but the objective material reality under which people lived. That is, *what really matters is matter*.

Marx rides the waves of these movements. He combined the *dialectics* of Hegel and the new developments of *materialism*. He noticed that European history follows some type of logic like Hegel said. There was an observable pattern that leads to a revolutionary leap, which changes the pattern and repeats the process.

### Marx's five stages of society

1. Hunter-gatherer
2. Feudalism
3. Capitalism
4. Socialism
5. Communism

What accounts for progress from the steps, for Marx, was *material circumstances*. For him, the best way of investigating these circumstances was to investigate that society's **means of production**. 

For example, hunter-gather societies don't *own* anything. They sleep, hunt, and forage whenever possible. Eventually, they invent agriculture, and land becomes the primary means of production. He looks in Europe and sees that there are *landlords* that own the land. Those landlords cannot work the land by themselves, so they need labor. This is a feudal society.

In the 17th century, we see the emergence of industry. While agriculture still exists, the *primary* means of production becomes industry and factories. That is, there is much more money to be made in industry than conducting agriculture. Who owns these industries? *Capitalists*. These capitalists are distinct from their workers.

Because Marx was observing capitalism in his time, socialism and communism were only theories. But because Marx thought that he saw the logical progression of society, he knew that socialism and communism would come eventually. Lay people could look at this thinking and justify the revolutionary behavior that workers engaged in at that time. *It gave them something to believe in*.

Hegel viewed this progress as scientific. That is, it was as unavoidable as gravity. revolutionaries could die knowing that they helped bring about the inevitable.

> [!definition]
> **Socialism** was the next step from capitalism. It describes ownership of the means of production by the workers. In practice, it means state-ownership with the state representing the workers.

> [!definition]
> A **class** is a shared strata of society with a shared understanding of their interests in their society. Capitalists are one such class, and workers (proletariat) are the other.

Marx observed that the proletariat were not aware of their class-ness. They don't have the consciousness necessary to observe their conditions. He believed that, eventually, the proletariat would become aware of their exploitation, rise up, and bring about a change to *socialism*.

> [!definition]
> Socialism is not the end of the chain. In socialism, a dictatorial state owns the means of production on behalf of the proletariat. In contrast **communism** involves a stateless society. The state will naturally wither and disappear once classes have been done away with because its functions will be made redundant or obsolete.
