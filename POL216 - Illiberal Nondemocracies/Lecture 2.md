# What is at stake?

One country that is actively suffering under a function democracy is India. Their elections are happening fairly, but ethnic divides are causing conflicts that could explode into something more severe. This speaks to potential issues with democracy's tendency towards majority rule.

Another example of unfettered democracy going wrong is Nazi Germany's legitimate democratic election of Adolf Hitler.

## Why are we concerned?

We all need to get our food from somewhere. Most of us pay for it at some store (with some exception for subsistance farmers/homesteaders). We similarly pay for water, shelter, clothing, etc. We depend on others for even the most basic needs of our lives. Most of us can't even imagine life without electricity.

We all live in, and depend on, society. This is true whether we choose to do so or not. We were born into society without consent. Even if we wanted to, we don't have the skills to survive in the wild on our own.

The complexities of society are immense, and they are secured by the **state**.

> The more needs we have that are provided by institutions (public or private), the stronger we need the state to be.

In 17th-century Europe, states basically only guaranteed security and collected taxes. There was no public school, public utilities, etc. They handled international relations and domestic security. But now, we have highly complex societies and highly powerful states. In fact, the power of our systems are so high, that leaving those systems never even occurs to us. Did our parents consider not educating us and instead moving to live off the land? For the great majority of us, never. *That* is power.

We were, for much of our history as a species, were able to evade the state should you want to. Now, evading the state is impossible, what with credit cards, security cameras, etc.

Because the institution of the state is so powerful, how that body functions is of the utmost importance. Saying "I don't care what the state does" is simply not a valid choice. Democracy is one way that humanity has created to organize these states. 

## More than democracy

Democracy alone is not enough. At the end of the day, the needs of the people, to include economic needs, recreational needs, opportunity, etc., must be met. Singapore is far lower on the Democracy Index than Taiwan, but most would argue that Singapore is a much more livable place. 

On one side, you may have a state that maximizes the society's ability to meet the needs of its people. On the other, a state may maximize *opportunity* more than guarantee it. There is a spectrum between the two, and it frequently follows left (meet the needs) and right (opportunity, not guarantees) political divides. Frequently, even in the US, we hear that one party or the other is sacrificing opportunity for guarantees or vice-versa.
