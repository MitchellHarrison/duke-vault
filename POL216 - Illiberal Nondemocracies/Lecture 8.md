## Liberalism

For Hobbes, human nature was inherently violent. Because of this, he thought that life in the state of nature was short, full of warfare, and miserable. Rousseau thought the opposite: human nature is generous and kind but has been corrupted by society. Thus, the state of nature is peace.

Hobbes lived during the English civil war, which framed his belief that humans were inherently violent. He saw the government as a necessary body to keep humanity from violently destroying itself. In Hobbes' view, individuals could give their rights to a King for him to exercise for them. This would be done for the common good, since with a King's absolute power, he could wield it for the benefit of society as a whole.

For Mill, freedom of speech (and individuality in general) should be protected. For him, the open sharing of ideas allows society to come together towards truth. This is similar to **dialectics** and **synthesis** that we discussed in previous lectures.
