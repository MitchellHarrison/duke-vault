## Rationalization

Weber discusses **rationalization**. He suggests that at some point in history, there is a switch from personal rule to the person being in charge becoming irrelevant. At that point, the *office* matters more than the *individual* in that office. This is the change from *traditional* to *rational* rule.

For example, if there is a secretary in an office building, he or she has access to only certain information, rooms, etc. As long as the person doing the job is qualified to do it, the identity of the person as an individual is unimportant for the functioning of the role of secretary. That is, the role transcends the individual.

There are gradients to rationalizations. For example, China has a rationalized system, but when Xi Jinping took power in China in 2014, the entire system (and country) changed dramatically and rapidly.
