## Continuation on Democracy

There is no single definition of democracy that is correct for all people in all times. It is an evolving concept that has taken different shapes in different places and times. However, if we reduce democracy into discussions about how policy leaders are chosen, we leave out a large part of the discussion.

We might say that we have democracy if we have fair, frequent, and free elections. But it is also about how power is distributed, both institutionally and geographically. We could hypothetically design a system in which every four years, we elect a dictator with absolute power. Even if we assume that such a leader willingly leaves power after those four years, do we still have democracy?

But in such a system, the decision making powers are not decentralized. Putin, for example, is elected. Even if we assume Russian elections to be fair (which we shouldn't),  we would still say that Russia is less democratic than the US. In the US, decisions are made at the county, city, state, and other levels. This distribution of policy power is what makes such a system more democratic than the Russian system, even in its ideal form.

## Mill and Liberalism

Mill uses China as an example of a society where social pressures to conform. He is very skeptical of social expectations, with or without state backing, to conform. It is crucial to note that Mill was writing from a place of ignorance, however. He had never read any Confucian texts or any other eastern philosophical texts. So although he was correct based on the distribution of power, lack of intellectual diversity, etc. in China, he still has a lot of personal prejudice in his work.
