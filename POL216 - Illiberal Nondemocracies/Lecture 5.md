### What does “democracy” mean etymologically?

It combines "dēmos" (people) and "kratos" (rule) in Greek.

### What about oligarchy, monarchy, anarchy, aristocracy, plutocracy, etc.

"Arkhein" (to rule) is combined with various prefixes to denote different forms of rule. Oligarchy is by the few, monarchy is by an individual, anarchy is "without rule," aristocracy is rule by "the best," plutocracy is by the wealthy, etc.

### What did Aristotle say about these modes of government?

He preferred a mixed system (polity) between aristocracy and democracy. Aristocracy devolved into oligarchy or plutocracy. He was very aware of difficulties that a pure democracy would bring.

### Who is the “demos” in democracy?

"People" in Greek

### Is democracy the best mode of government for the fulfillment of human potentials?

We have seen democracy fail to provide human rights to its citizens time and time again, but these are compromises of democratic principles. To date, "democratic principles," when enacted, seem to provide the best conditions for human potential to flourish.

### What does democracy entail? Not entail?

Democracy entails free, frequent, and fair elections that put leaders in power that are chosen by the population. It does not necessarily entail liberal rights, but often accompanies them. It does not, however, promise unregulated freedom, economic equality, or equality of power. That is, 49/51 vote splits do not mean that 49% of people hold 49% of political power.

### What are the mechanics of democracy? How does “demos” rule?

1. Political participation by citizens
2. Doctrines created by politicians in their current (not future) political interest.
3. Social structure/large middle class
4. A stable political class enjoying some perks of being elite, but sharing status with business owners, intellectuals, etc.
5. Some representational system (Congress, Parliament, etc.)
6. Market economy.
7. Private property rights.
8. Laws made by representative government.
9. Knowledge is decentralized/not weaponized by the state.
10. Diffusion of information (e.g., newspapers instead of state propaganda)
11. Active political debate/disagreement.

### Have these mechanics changed over time?

Democracies usually came from republics or limited monarchies. "Active participation," for example, changes as who is allowed to participate changes. Similar evolutions occur when property laws, press freedoms, etc. evolve.

### Do we have to trust the choices of common people in order to maintain a democracy?

Democracy requires what the author calls *good citizens*, or at least *active* ones. For democracy to work, we have to trust that (on average) people will vote to enact policies that at least attempt to bring about some positive change to their community/state, whether or not they succeed.

### Who should vote? Can you identify in history different opinions about who should vote?

We went from white, land-owning men, to all men but un-equally, to all men, to all adults over our short history. Different times in different periods evolved differently, but powerful men of some type seem to be the baseline.

### Are people good in nature? Or bad? Does this matter for democracy?

An argument could be made (and is made by one Bishop Gardiner) that power rests in the "nature of the people." That is if enough people are of bad nature, then elected leaders, and thereby laws and norms, could poison existing democratic institutions.

Therefore, in some ways, democracy assumes at least some level of "base-goodness" of the citizenry.

### Should property, education, tax payment, citizenship, etc. be required to vote?

Inclusive citizenship is a requirement for democracy, claimed Dahl. But this does not always extend to non-citizen permanent residents. Apart from that requirement, more universal suffrage is "more democratic."

### What is the role of communication/media in the functioning of democracy?

*Diffusion of information* is one of the conditions of modern democracy given by the author. Autocracies lack the "regular news, rumor, and gossip" that have become social institutions in modern democracies. Our democracy depends more and more on people having access to relatively accurate information (whether or not they use that access seems to be up for debate).

### Is democracy good? If it is good, is it good in principle or because it provides benefits?

Democracy isn't without its dangers, as Tocqueville emphasized. Materialism, hyper-individuality, and tyranny of the majority could very well bring significant horrors to democracy. However, in practice, it seems to provide sufficient material conditions and the approval of those conditions (on average) over time.

### What are the benefits of democracy?

Tocqueville said that the greatest benefit of (American) democracy was the smaller centralized administration in favor of effective, local self-governance. Democracy is a relationship between individual rights, the state, and intermediary groups. This gives rise to the greatest possible levels of freedom and civil rights (although not perfectly) of any system so far.

### Name some important theoreticians who have influenced our understanding of democracy today. Hobbes, Rousseau, Founding Fathers, Mill, Tocqueville, etc.

Hobbes thought that the state of nature was one of conflict, and he helped begin the idea of the social contract, to which we agree implicitly to keep society functioning and at peace.

Rousseau wrote a book called *The Social Contract* that was obviously influenced by Hobbes. He believed that legitimate political authority could only arise from the will of the people.

The Founding Fathers built on these ideas to write the Federalist Papers and the US Constitution. They formalized a government raised by the people by creating what we know today as the American democratic system: representative government, separation of powers, independent judiciary, etc.

John Stuart Mill was an ardent proponent of individual liberty, free speech, etc. but also warned against a common concern with democracy: the tyranny of the majority.

Tocqueville warned against the tyranny of the majority (similarly to Mill), but also concerned himself with the potential for rampant individualism and materialism that American democracy could bring about. His idea that wide political participation is required for democracy to function is still influential today.

Dahl (the most contemporary author here) developed a mixed-democratic concept of **polyarchy**, which combines representative rule and civil liberties, but does not attempt to pursue some ideal of direct citizen control.

### What is the relationship between free market economy and democracy? Knowledge and democracy? Information flow and democracy? Law and democracy? Culture and democracy?

**Market:** Free-market capitalism seems to being economic prosperity for the largest number, and *laissez-faire* economics seems to merge well with a democratically-minded culture.

**Knowledge:** Monopolized knowledge has been a weapon/tool of totalitarian states. 

**Information:** The decentralization of information-gathering (and thereby the democratization of information and access to it) is a crucial component of democracy, especially as freedom of the press is counted here.

**Law:** Laws are created by democratically-elected leaders, and in theory, they should represent the general will and best interest of the people. Frequent elections ensure that political representation stays true to the represented.

**Culture:** A democratic culture (as well as one that encouraged political participation) is required to maintain a functioning democracy.
